vlcj
====

The vlcj project provides a Java framework to allow an instance of a native
[vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc "vlc") media player to be embedded in a Java 
AWT Window or Swing JFrame. 

You get more than just simple bindings, you also get a higher level framework
that hides a lot of the complexities of working with libvlc.

vlcj works just fine on Linux and Windows and should work on Mac - but for Mac
you likely need a bleeding-edge release of vlc.

At least JDK 1.5 is required, JDK 1.6 is recommended, and it works without 
changes on JDK 1.7.

This is the open source vlcj project page, see also the 'official' 
[home page](http://www.capricasoftware.co.uk/vlcj "Official vlcj home page at Caprica Software")
where you can find more information as well as some new simple tutorials.
